## Abstract
Financial volatility prediction is vital for characterizing a companyâ€™s risk profile. Transcripts of companiesâ€™ earnings calls serve as valuable, yet unstructured, data sources to be utilized to access companiesâ€™ performance and risk profiles. Despite their importance, current works ignore the role of financial metrics knowledge (such as EBIT, EPS, and ROI) in transcripts, which is crucial for understanding companiesâ€™ performance, and little consideration is given to integrating text and price information. In this work, we statistically analyze common financial metrics and create a special dataset centered on these metrics. Then, we propose a knowledge-enhanced financial volatility prediction method (KeFVP) to inject knowledge of financial metrics into text comprehension by knowledge-enhanced adaptive pre-training (KePt) and effectively integrating text and price information by introducing a conditional time series prediction module. Extensive experiments are conducted on three realworld public datasets, and the results indicate that KeFVP is effective and outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods.

## Requirements

### Installation
Create a conda environment and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:hankniu01/KeFVP.git
cd kefvp

conda create -n kefvp python=3.8
conda activate kefvp

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Dataset
### Raw Dataset
Please follow [README.md](https://github.com/GeminiLn/EarningsCall_Dataset) to download official EC datasets, and follow [README.md](https://github.com/Earnings-Call-Dataset/MAEC-A-Multimodal-Aligned-Earnings-Conference-Call-Dataset-for-Financial-Risk-Prediction) to download maec-15 and maec-16 datsets. 

### Tine Series
Price Data is stored in `price_data` folder.

### Dataset For KePt
Download from [kept_dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Xe7Y64F04X9GkWMOSZmSmpV1f5I1ySgM?usp=sharing), and place them in `kept_dataset` folder.

### KePt Pratrained Embeddings
Download from [kept_embedding_for_ec](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F83bjiJKEpq_MYrc0lzQb9rOLgooz-5E?usp=sharing), and place them in `text_embedding` folder. Only for the EC dataset, the MAEC file is too large to be available.

## Get Started

### Running KePt

```bash
cd pretain
bash kept_run.sh
```
### Running KeFVP
```bash
cd kefvp
bash ./scripts/run_ec_for_kept.sh
```
